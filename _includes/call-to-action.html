                <p class="text-faded">I live in beautiful Boulder, Colorado, where I currently work at the City of Boulder as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst with our Innovation & Technology Department. I have a background in Public Policy, Economics, & Analytics and I love seeing people connect to their community through data. I've worked in consulting, as well as the private sector, and I have experience with data visualization, ETL/ELT, integration, and engineering, and have worked with many tools in these spaces. I'm originally from the Atlanta suburbs, and have spent time living in Raleigh, NC, Peoria, IL, Perth, Western Australia, and New Orleans, LA. I'm happiest outside and most weekends you can find me in the mountains (hiking, running, backpacking, or skiing). I'd love to meet up over a coffee or beer (maybe after we hit the trail!).</p>
